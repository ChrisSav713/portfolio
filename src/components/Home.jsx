        I'm a career-changer with a background in custodial work and a strong
        foundation in Computer Science. After a decade of hands-on, reliable
        work, I reignited my passion for technology and completed a full-stack
        coding bootcamp. I'm now focused on building clean, maintainable
        applications using modern tools like React, JavaScript, and Python. I
        thrive on learning by doingâ€”whether it's developing full-stack projects,
        exploring new frameworks, or solving real-world problems through code.
